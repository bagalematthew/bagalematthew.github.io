# GitHub Pages Starter

A clean, responsive, no-framework starter for GitHub Pages.

## How to deploy (quick)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `<your-username>.github.io` (for a user site) **or** any name for a project site.
2. Upload these files to the repository root (or use Git).
3. For project sites: enable Pages in **Settings → Pages**, set "Deploy from branch" and choose the `main` branch and `/root` folder.
4. Wait for the green check ✔ to finish, then visit:
   - User site: `https://<your-username>.github.io`
   - Project site: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<reponame>`

## Customization

- Edit `index.html` with your name, links, and content.
- Put a square `assets/favicon.png` to brand the tab icon.
- Replace `resume.pdf` (optional) with your actual resume.
